# ImageProcessing_Panorama

In this exercise i've implemented automatic ‚ÄùStereo Mosaicking".

First a video is splitted info frames.

The homography between frames is calculated with Harris corner detector and sample descriptors, and the RANSAC algorithm.

After that the panorama is getting stitched all toghether.

Notes:

The class PanoramicVideoGenerator and the file my_panorama.py was given and was not written by me.
